Welcome to my profile ...

My name is Daniel Engvall, and living in Sweden 🇸🇪 together with rest of my family.
I use Github for my personal projects that includes code majority of those written in [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)) 🐍 that is and has been one of my primary programming languge after I've been exposed to languages such as [Basic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC), [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B), [Perl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl), [Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(programming_language)), [PHP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP) while I developed quite sophisticated solutions using Bash but the pursue for a dynamic full spectrum language to runs well from anything from microcontrollers and embedded systems  (anyone remembers [Dreambox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreambox)?) to scalable server application, and an excellent tool for statistical analysis 📈

Also home automations and microcontrollers (where )

However.. outside of my personal space I've also used [Groovy/Java](Groovy/Java).

More recent burning passion also being in understanding and writing more maintanble software using good practices and software design.





I have a burning passion for writing good designed software primarily using Python.
As personal projects currently pushed to Github they are in total {{d['repos_count']}} of them as of today 😊
